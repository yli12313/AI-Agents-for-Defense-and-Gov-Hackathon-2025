# Maritime Port Digital Twin - Security Dashboard

This project aims to create a digital twin of a maritime port, visualizing IoT devices and their vulnerability status using RAG (Red-Amber-Green) scores. The dashboard also integrates an AI-driven attack vector advisor to suggest potential threats.

## Features:
- **IoT Device Mapping**: Visualize IoT devices with their vulnerability scores.
- **RAG Status**: Devices are color-coded based on vulnerability score (Red, Amber, Green).
- **AI Attack Vector Advisor**: Recommends attack strategies based on device vulnerabilities.
- **Ship Arrival Simulation**: Simulate the addition of new IoT devices when ships arrive.

## Technology Stack:
- **Backend**: Python
- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **Data**: Static JSON files for initial demonstration
- **AI**: OpenAI API (optional for attack vector analysis)

## Setup Instructions:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_name>
